%  how are these entities mapped on to the physical distributed infrastructure (i.e., what is their placement)?

\subsubsection{Placement}

As the clients are applications intended to be run on smartphones while the user is out and about, they are intrinsically scattered globally.

To ensure reasonable delay to users across the globe, the server(s) will be hosted in the cloud.

Hosting the server in the cloud gives easy access to all users and makes scaling the server capacity as the application grows much easier. Using a cloud service also lets us outsource maintenance and fault tolerance of the server to a third party. 


%The clients run on smart phones and are therefore intrinsically scattered globally

%The clients will interact with applet code. The applet will send requests to the server at regular intervals, and display the needed information to the client. As only a subset of the nodes will be viewed by the client at any time, the applet will optimize the requested data to minimize delay.

%The server/servers will be located statically, interacted with through the network. For security reasons separate machines may be used for backup at different locations, in case of unexpected events.
