\subsection{Problem Description}

The problem we have recognized is that whenever you want to go out to drink, have fun, or to meet with friends, it is hard to make an informed decision about which venue to choose. When choosing a venue, you might want to know different factors, such as the number of people there, if any of your friends are present, what kind of music do the people who are currently there like, and so on and so forth. Currently, this is not possible.
