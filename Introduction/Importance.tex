\subsection{Why is the problem important?}

% Det handler om tryghed. Når man går i byen/er ude vil man gerne have det sjovt, og gerne i de rammer man ønsker og med de mennesker man ønsker. Det er træls at have det træls. 

Metropolitan areas containing great venues are often filled to the brim with mediocre or sub-par venues. Selecting the right venue is a complicated problem depending on many factors. The right venue could depend on the time of day, personal preference and current occupancy. This makes this problem dauntingly difficult to solve without seeking further information about the different possibilities.

The difficulty of this problem is even higher when the desired venue is a bar or nightclub. Since the quality of bars and nightclubs are hugely dependant on the crowd it is hard to generalize from night to night how good a bar or nightclub is. While in general selecting the wrong venue or spending too long trying to select the right venue is simply a waste of time, trying to find the right nightclub can be a costly affair.
